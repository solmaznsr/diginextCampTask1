# diginextCampTask1
This repository contains various test tasks for practice and evaluation purposes. The tasks are designed to cover different aspects of programming, problem-solving, and algorithm development.

**task 1** : The algorithm treats the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array and applies binary search to find the target value. This approach leverages the sorted nature of the matrix rows and the ordering between rows to perform the search efficiently.

**task 2** : The script reads a list of strings from user input, groups anagrams together, and prints the result. The grouping is achieved by sorting the letters in each string and using the sorted string as a key in a hash table.

**task 3** : The script reads a sequence of integers from the user, finds the longest consecutive sequence of numbers, and displays both the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

**task 4**: The program first asks for the number of intervals. Then, it prompts the user to enter the start and end points of each interval. It merges intervals that overlap and outputs the merged intervals.
